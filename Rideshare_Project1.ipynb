You now have a wealth of insights to present regarding the statistics of rides in Chicago and some key metrics that affect drivers. Proceed to the \"Chicago Rideshare Project: Part 1 Report\" module in the Pathstream platform to begin writing up your report. You can leave this lab open or return to it later to gather materials after previewing the Google Doc report template. "
